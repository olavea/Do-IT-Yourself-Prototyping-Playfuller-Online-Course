Lillian (5.5 ðŸ¦„) bicycles back from kindergarten every weekday after playing outdoors with her friends.

Here is Lillian climbing the tallest tree at Rohdes Square on her way back from kindergarten.

One monday morning the mailman gives Lillian (5.5 ðŸ¦„) a Postcard.

Â«Dear Lillian,
Sorry. Your kindergarten is closed because: Corona Obsidialis.
Don't worry, be happy :-)
Erna ðŸŒ… ðŸ—»
Primus NorvegicusÂ»

Lillian goes alone into her backyard and plays by herself, pretending har friends are with her. Suddenly:

Â«Psst! Girl! Up here!Â» Says NewGirl.
Â«Hi...Â» Says Lillian.
Â«I know how to get Primus Erna to re-open all the kindergartens so all the children can play with their friends again.Â» Says NewGirl.


Â«Really?Â» Says Lillian.
Â«Really. Climb up here on the rooftop and i will show you howÂ» Says NewGirl.
Â«No. Tell me your plan first.Â» Says Lillian who is not going to admit her father forbids her to climb the rooftop.
Â«My plan is to bring a special person to talk some sense into Ernas head.Â» Says NewGirl.

Â«Who is your friend, and how will she even get into Ernas house to talk to her?Â» Says Lillian.
Â«That is what I am going to show you when you climb up here. Duh!Â» Says NewGirl.

Â«Your plan is stupid. I will never wotk.Â» Says Lillian.
Â«Fine. be like that. play on your own.Â» Says NewGirl.

Â«I will. I am playing inside so I don't have to look at your stupid face.Â» Lillian goes inside and slams the door..


Â«Daaad, I want to go on a bicycle ride in the neighbourhood. Can you come pleeeaaase?Â» Says Lillian.
Â«I love going on bike rides with you, but what do Mum and I do on Mondays and Tuesdays?Â» Says Dad.



Â«Work ALL day... How about wednesday? Oh nooo... .Â» Says Lillian thinking sadly about what she will do all day without kindergarten and her friends there.
Â«Mum and I need to work real hard these weeks to make POW! easy to use for the ladies. You know that.Â» Says Dad.

Â«I know. I know.Â» Says Lillian.
Â«You CAN help us if you want, but it is going to be work, not play .Â» Says Dad.

Â«No. I want to build something BIG. Outside! In our backyard. A unicorny Climbing-Ship. Taller than our house. So I can see out whole neighbourhood from the mast top. I want to use my pink bosch-drill.Â» Says Lillian.
Â«Well well Lillian, I will only say yes to a Climbing-Ship on one condition.Â» Says Dad.

Â«Tell me.Â» Says Lillian.
Â«You must actually screw in every one of those hundreds of screws on your own. I can help you to get the screws stuck in the planks, but only that.Â» Says Dad.

Â«I promise. I promise. I will build alone and NOT distroct you while you work.Â» Says Lillian.
Â«Good. Run along to your Mum and ask for the money.Â» Says Dad.

What will happen to Lillian?
Will she be able to find a way to get Erna to re-open the kindergartens?
Will Lillian have fun building alone?

When last we left our hero, all was not well.
Fortunaatley when kindergarten was closed Lillian got the Postcard with the reason, even though the reason sounded alien. Corona Obsidialis, what did the words even mean? Not that she cared what the problem was anymore. Lillian had changed her mind about the NewGirl, because she had SOMETHING she could do to re-open kindergarten. And Lillian knew there was only one way to find out if something worked, to try and try until you made it work.

The Do-IT-Yourself-Ship-Set for backyards is delivered. Lillian builds & builds & climbs onto the roof of the half finished Ship.


Â«Hey! NewGirl!Â» Lillian shouts.
Â«Oh no! Not YOU again!.Â» Says NewGirl.

Â«Show me how you will get this special friend of yours to Erna Primus Norvegicus.Â» Says Lillian.
Â«Say please.Â» Says NewGirl.

Â«Please.Â» Says Lillian.
Â«Boom-Shaka-Lacka!Â» Says NewGirl and pulls a pink piece of cloth off og a gloriously white TimeShip with a rainbowy unicorn horn.

Â«Oooh! It' a TimeShip! The unicorny TimeShip with the special rainbowy horn that glows in the dark.Â» Says Lillian.
Â«Yes.Â» Says NewGirl with a cat-got-the-cream smile.
Â«I have heard about it in one of my audiobooks. Cool. Where did you buy it? On the internet?Â» Says Lillian.
Â«Forget about that, don't you want all the children in Norway to play with their friends again?Â» Says NewGirl.

Â«Yes. YES!Â» Says Lillian.
Â«Let's go pick up the ONE historical person who can convince Erna Solberg.Â» Says NewGirl.

Â«I guess you plan to sail back in time and get some super convincing lady. A Queen maybe?Â» Says Lillian.
Â«Yes actually.Â» Says NewGirl.
Â«Ok, I'll just ask my dad when I need to be back for dinner, get a few things and YOU sail your TimeShip down here.Â» Says Lillian pointing at the gravel.
Â«YOU climb up HERE.Â» Says NewGirl.
Â«No.Â» Says Lillian.
Â«Well, about THAT. I might have a tiiiny glitch...Â» Says NewGirl.
Â«Glitch? Stop complaining abou a glitch. Turn it off and on again.Â» Says Lillian
Â«Yeah-No. I have tried both.Â» Says NewGirl.

Â«Does the time-travel-engine still work, I mean can you sail in time still?Â» Says Lillian
Â«Yes. I can sail in time and space, just not, you know "sail around".Â» Says NewGirl.
Â«Good. Just push your Ship closer to the edge of the roof, and when I come back out you push it all the way down to the ground.Â» Says Lillian.
Â«Nooo!Â» Says NewGirl.
Â«Yes. I'll be right back.Â» Lillian goes inside and comes back out carrying a pink lunch box and a rope under one arm and a glittery, green helmet under the other arm. Lillian straps the helmet on, tosses the rope end up and says.
Â«Tie the rope around the horn. Now push! And we'll get in and sail off!Â»
Â«Poor beautiful Ship.Â» NewGirl says and pushes the TimeShip down with a crash! The two girls get inside quick and sail off with a POOOF!

What happens in the past mostly stays in the past, but

A quick summary:
Lillian learns that NewGirls name is Ruby and that Ruby's special friend is Queen Elizabeth.

The tree of them returns from their sailing trip in time, landing inside Erna's home office.
It was kind of awkward for several reasons, one reason was the second lady stepping out of the TimeShip with a bag over her head and Lillian's rope around hands and feet. The "witness".

The conversation was ALSO awkward at first, but both heads of state were used to weird conversations however so they soon came to the understanding that they needed the room alone.

Â«Please leave us.Â» Says Erna SÃ¥lbÃ¸rg.

Lillian, Ruby, Erna's people leave for the living room where cookies and tea are served by a burly police officer.

Â«What ARE they talking about in there?Â» Says Lillian.
Â«I have NO clue, but don't worry. Elizabeth is GOOD at talking to politicans. The best maybe. She knows the game of power backwards. But where DID you tell your dad you were going?Â» Says NewGirl.

Â«To the closed kindergarten next door. I don't like lying to dad, but I will ask for forgiveness when I come home.Â» Says Lillian.

Later, Erna and Elizabeth comes out smiling. Lillian and Ruby waits in silence.

Â«I am glad to say I will open all the kindergartens!Â» Says Erna smiling a big smile.

Â«Yess!Â» Says Lillian.
Â«Let's get you home.Â» Says Ruby.

Here is Lillian on her way home from playing outdoors all day with her friends at kindergarten. In her head she sees a picture of the new addition to her Climbing-Ship.
